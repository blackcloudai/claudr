# Claudr

## Cross-Language AWSCLI User Command Translator
by Author: BlackCloudAi.com

### Overview 

Claudr is a versatile tool designed to transform AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) commands into equivalent code in various programming languages, starting with Python using the Boto3 SDK. It's an essential utility for developers, cloud engineers, and IT professionals who seek to automate AWS operations or embed AWS functionalities into their applications across different programming environments.

### Features 

#### Multi-Language Support: 

Initially provides translations to Python (Boto3), with a roadmap to include other languages such as JavaScript (Node.js), Java, and more.

#### AWS Services Coverage: 

Offers support for a variety of AWS services, beginning with popular choices like S3 and EC2, and expanding to cover a comprehensive range of AWS offerings.

#### Modular and Extensible: 

Designed with a modular architecture to facilitate the addition of new parsers and extend support for more languages and AWS services.

#### User-Centric Design: 

Intuitive and accessible, Claudr is crafted for both novice and seasoned AWS users.

#### Learning and Development: 

A great resource for understanding the conversion of AWS CLI commands into different programming languages, fostering a deeper understanding of cloud programming paradigms.

#### Claudr CDK-Workflows 

This new feature integrates AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK) support. Claudr CDK-Workflows enables users to translate AWS CLI commands into high-level CDK constructs and workflows. This addition is especially beneficial for users who prefer infrastructure as code (IaC) practices, as it simplifies the transition from manual cloud resource management to automated, code-based approaches. It’s ideal for developing and deploying full-stack applications on AWS, making infrastructure management more efficient and scalable.

#### Why Claudr CDK-Workflows is Beneficial 

Claudr CDK-Workflows facilitates a seamless transition to using AWS CDK, a preferred tool for defining cloud infrastructure in code. It enhances automation, enabling developers to quickly prototype and deploy AWS resources. This feature is particularly useful for those who are new to AWS CDK, providing an intuitive way to understand and implement CDK by translating familiar CLI commands. It supports scalable and repeatable cloud infrastructure deployment, aligning with modern development practices.
 
### Getting Started 

#### Prerequisites 

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from python.org.

2. Git should be installed for cloning the repository. If you don't have Git, you can download it from git-scm.com.

### Installation Instructions for Unix-like Systems (Linux/Mac)

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blackcloudai/claudr.git
cd claudr
```

#### Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional)

It's a good practice to use a virtual environment for Python projects. This keeps your project dependencies separate from your system-wide Python packages.

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

#### Step 3: Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Step 4:  Make the Script Executable

Navigate to the script directory and make `main.py` executable:

```bash
chmod +x main.py
```

#### Step 5: Rename  `main.py` to `claudr`(Optional)

```bash
mv main.py claudr
```

#### Step 6: Create a Symbolic Link

```bash
ln -s /claudr/scr/main.py /usr/local/bin/claudr
```

#### Step 7: Test your command

```bash
claudr --help
```

### Installation Instructions for Windows

### Step 1: Add Script to a Directory in Your PATH

Copy `main.py` to a directory that is in your system's PATH. For instance, you might use `C:\Windows\System32`.

### Step 2: Rename `main.py` to `claudr.py` (Optional)

For convenience, you can rename `main.py` to `claudr.py`.


### Step 3: Create a Batch File to Run the Script

Create a new file named `claudr.bat` in the same directory where you placed `claudr.py`, with the following contents:

```bat
@echo off
python %~dp0claudr.py %*
```

### Usage

Provide examples demonstrating how to translate AWS CLI commands into different programming languages

```bash 
claudr [code] aws [service] [command] [--options] 
```

Example: 

```bash 
claudr python aws s3 ls 
```

### Roadmap

Future plans for additional language support and features
